Installing and upgrading
###########################

The Python Processor is not yet released for version 1.0 of the Open Ephys GUI. An announcement will be made via Discord/Slack when it's available for download via Plugin Installer.

Setting up a Python environment
####################################

This plugin must be able to find a local installation of Python version **3.10** with :code:`numpy` installed correctly.

To avoid conflicts with other Python installations, we recommend using `Conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/index.html>`__ to manage your Python environments. You can install Conda either using Miniconda or Anaconda by following the instructions `here <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/download.html>`__. More information on how to use Conda can be found `here <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html>`__.

.. important:: On macOS, conda needs to be installed using the x86_64 Miniconda / Anaconda installer. 

To create a new Conda environment that uses Python 3.10, enter the following :code:`conda` command in your Anaconda prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux and macOS):

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n oe-python-plugin python=3.10

This will create a new Conda environment with Python 3.10 installed. Then, activate this newly created environment like so:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate oe-python-plugin

After this, :code:`numpy` needs to be installed in the same environment as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install numpy

.. important:: On Windows, if you use :code:`pip` to install Python packages, the plugin will fail to load your Python module. We are still investigating the cause of this issue.


Setting the Python Interpreter Path
-------------------------------------

Once a dedicated Python 3.10 Conda environment has been created, the plugin is ready to be loaded into any desired signal chain. As soon as the plugin is dropped into the signal chain, it asks for the path to Python Home directory, which is where the Python Interpreter is located. This allows the plugin to be flexible in terms of which Python libraries to use during runtime, and not rely on the system PATH to figure out the Python Home location. 

When using Conda, this path is usually where the Conda environment got created. Some examples of where it may be located: 

* Windows: :code:`C:\\Users\\<username>\\miniconda3` or :code:`C:\\miniconda3`

* macOS - :code:`~/miniconda3` or :code:`/Users/<username>/miniconda3`

* Linux - :code:`~/miniconda3` or :code:`/home/<username>/miniconda3`

The Python image in a Conda environment called “oe-python-plugin” might be in a location such as :code:`${USERHOME}\\miniconda3\\envs\\oe-python-plugin`

If you have installed Anaconda instead of Miniconda, the folder might be named :code:`Anaconda` or :code:`Anaconda3`.

Once the path is selected, the plugin should load into the signal chain successfully. If it fails to load the Python Interpreter, then it will ask for the PATH to Python Home again. This means that either the provided PATH was incorrect, or an incompatible version of Python was installed (i.e., not 3.10). If this happens, it is recommended to close and relaunch the GUI to reset the PATH variables.

Creating & loading a Python Module
####################################

Once the plugin is loaded into the signal chain, a Python module (script) needs to be loaded into the GUI. This module should take the same form as the `processor template <https://github.com/open-ephys-plugins/python-processor/blob/main/Modules/template/processor_template.py>`__ provided in the plugin's GitHub repository. The :code:`PyProcessor` class is designed to expose the following functions to the Python module to allow interaction with the incoming data:  

.. py:method:: __init__(processor, num_channels, sample_rate)

   A new processor is initialized when the module is imported/reloaded, or the plugin's settings are updated (i.e., the number of input channels changes, or a new stream is selected).
   
   :param object processor: Python Processor class object used for adding events from python.
   :param int num_channels: number of input channels from the selected stream
   :param float sample_rate: the selected stream's sample rate

.. py:method:: process(data)

   Process each incoming data buffer. Any modifications to the :code:`data` variable will be passed to downstream processors.

   :param ndarrary data: N x M numpy array, where N = num_channles, M = num of samples in the buffer.

.. py:method:: start_acquisition()

   Called before starting acquisition. Allows the script to do some setup/initialization before acquisition starts.

.. py:method:: stop_acquisition()

   Called after stopping acquisition. Allows the script to do some finalization after acquisition stops.

.. py:method:: start_recording(recording_dir)

   Called before starting recording. Informs the plugin that the GUI is now recording data, in case it needs to save any information of its own.

   :param str recording_dir: directory where recording related files are supposed to be stored

.. py:method:: stop_recording()

   Called before stopping recording. Informs the plugin that the GUI is no longer recording data.

.. py:method:: handle_ttl_event(source_node, channel, sample_number, line, state)
   
   Handle each incoming ttl event.

   :param int source_node: id of the processor this event was generated from
   :param str channel: name of the event channel
   :param int sample_number: sample number of the event
   :param int line: the line on which event was generated (0-255) 
   :param bool state: event state True (ON) or False (OFF)

.. py:method:: handle_spike(source_node, electrode_name, num_channels, num_samples, sample_number, sorted_id, spike_data)
   
   Handle each incoming spike.
   
   :param int source_node: id of the processor this spike was generated from
   :param str electrode_name: name of the electrode
   :param int num_channels: number of channels associated with the electrode type
   :param int num_samples: total number of samples in the spike waveform 
   :param int sample_number: sample number of the spike
   :param int sorted_id: the sorted ID for this spike
   :param ndarrary spike_data: waveform as N x M numpy array, where N = num_channels & M = num_samples (read-only).

Using this template, any type of data processing can be done in Python in real-time. The data buffer should be overwritten with the new processed data, which will be received by downstream processors.

.. Note:: Pay careful attention to the latency introduced by processing data in Python, especially with high-channel-count data.


There is also a way to send TTL events back from Python to C++. These events will be added to the event buffer for the downstream processors to handle. It is possible using a C++ function exposed to the Python module via an embedded module called :code:`oe_pyprocessor`.

.. py:method:: add_python_event(line, state)
   
   Send TTL event from Python to C++
   
   :param int line: event line number [0-255]
   :param bool state: event state True (ON) or False (OFF)

To use this function, the :code:`oe_pyprocessor` module needs to be imported inside the script and then the C++ function can be invoked by using the processor object provided in the :py:meth:`__init__` method, like this: :code:`self.processor.add_python_event(line, state)`

An example script is provided in the plugin's GitHub repository in the form of a `Butterworth Bandpass filter <https://github.com/open-ephys-plugins/python-processor/blob/main/Modules/examples/bandpass_filter.py>`__. This filter is the same as the one used in the GUI's built-in Filter Node plugin.

Limitations
######################

* Unlike continuous data and events, sending spikes back from Python is not currently possible.

* Only one instance of the plugin is allowed at a time in a signal chain. Having multiple instances of the plugin in the same signal chain will result in random crashes. 

* Creating visualizations in real-time using Python libraries such as :code:`matplotlib` is not possible.
